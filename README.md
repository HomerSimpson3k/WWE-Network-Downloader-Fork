WWE Network 2.0 Downloader (Improved)

Freyta's WWE Network Downloader, please don't share. This was coded by me from scratch, ideas were taken from youtube-dl.

Features include the following:
- Downloading from set start times
- Ending at certain times (i.e. only downloading certain matches)
- Qualtiy selection (currently hardcoded - CLI option coming in the future)
- Kodi NFO file creations (TV episode and Series only at the moment - PPV needs to be added)
- Part downloading (currently only saves where you have downloaded until - need to add continue downloading)
